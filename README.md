# Linear-predictive-Coding-
  The speech coding in this project will be
accomplished by using a modified version of LPC-10
technique. Linear Predictive Coding is one possible
technique.
  The overly simplistic model that the LPC coder
relies on has relatively low computational cost and
makes the low bit-rate speech coder a practical
reality. The uncomplicated model, however, is also
highly inaccurate in various circumstances,creating
annoying artifacts in the synthetic speech.This class of
coders works well for low bit-rate. Increasing the bit-
rate normally does not translate into better quality,
since it is restricted by the chosen model. Typical bit-
rate is in the range of 2 to 5 kbps.
Implementation Details are in the report in the repository.
